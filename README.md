Say Goodbye to dull and uninspiring captions mentioning ‚Äòorange and white cat stuffed animal‚Äô like you did years ago ‚Äì with the help of AI, you can come up with captions like 
```
A fun and fierce friend to accompany your child, from the crib till pre-school
```

Here we will create a **Python application** that would be able to process and answer questions in natural language template by extracting information from your PostgreSQL database. Next, we will explore even more advanced ideas to encode the new text and generate new **AI-derived product descriptions** üõçÔ∏èüé® for children toys üé≤üß© based on the dataset we have. 

Oh come on let‚Äôs put our AI-generated taglines ü§ñ‚ú® to work and probably get some interesting results! üéØ


### üöÄ Features:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. üìã Structured Database:**
   * product_id üÜî
   * product_name üéÅ
   * description üìù
   * list_price üíµ

**2. üîç Semantic Similarity Search**

**3. ‚úÇÔ∏è Intelligent Text Splitting**

**4. üß† AI-Generated Descriptions**


### How to install pgvector in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pgvector extension can be created into an existing Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance with the help of the following command. If you don‚Äôt have an instance yet, you can create one for [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-instance).

```
>> CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
>> CREATE EXTENSION
```

### 'vector` data type:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sample code below includes three-dimensional vectors It is worth stating that in real-life AI/ML applications, vectors possess hundreds of dimensions, even though, for the sake of demonstration, we used four-dimensional data only.


```
>> CREATE TABLE embeddings(
      id INTEGER,
      embedding vector(3)
);
CREATE TABLE


>> INSERT INTO embeddings 
           VALUES
                   (1, '[0, 0, 0]'),
                   (2, '[9, 9, 9]');
INSERT 0 2
```

# Building an application with a dataset:


Now that you have a general understanding of pgvector and LLMs, let‚Äôs begin the process of constructing your application with these tools. Not only that, but we also will utilize LangChain, which is an open-source tool offering several built-in modules to ease the development of intricate applications with LLMs.

### Summary:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fetch the Records and copy it in a PostgreSQL table of the name products.
   This table has 4 fields:
   * product_id: Int;
   * product_name: varchar ;
   *  description: LONGTEXT;
   *   list_price: decimal
     
2. Read each text value in the long description field, then break up each resultant value into smaller textual values for which vector embeddings are to be generated.
   
4. Split long text into smaller chunks with LangChain using [RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html) method.
   
6. The vector embeddings are then stored in another PostgreSQL table known as product_embeddings by using the pgvector extension. The product_embeddings table contains a foreign key representing a table with products.
   
8. After filtering the products according to the user query, generate vectors for the current user query and use the pgvector vector similarity search operators to find the most similar products to the vector of the current user query.


### Results:

* **Case 1:** **üîç Finding similar toys using pgvector cosine search operator**

* **Case 2: ü§ñ Building an AI-curated contextual hybrid search**
